Have you always wanted to fight Goliath?
This is the game for you!

* Play King David with the slingshot weapon, and eliminate the giant Goliath!
* You have 3 stones to throw with the slingshot (3 attempts total)
* The game is made up of 2 stages - with the second stage being more difficult,
* In the second stage - Goliath's giant sword is stuck in the ground and thus protects him from harm
